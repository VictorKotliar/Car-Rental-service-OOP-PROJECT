# Car-Rental-service-OOP-PROJECT
This project is part of my University studies, it involves using multiple files with methods and explanation
The first file is CAR.JAVA
This includes Class Car  which creates a class object with the parameters.
The file Car.java is heavily commented on and explained to make it easier to understand different parts of the code.
